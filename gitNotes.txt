* HOW TO PULL FROM MASTER
- `git pull origin master`

* HOW TO SWITCH BRANCH
- `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`

* HOW TO ADD CODE TO GITHUB
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m'MESSAGE HERE'`
- `git push origin BRANCH_NAME` (NOT MASTER!!!!!!!)
- make pull-request (PR) on GITHUB

* MADE A MISTAKE AND WANT TO START OVER FROM MASTER?? DO THIS:
- `git stash`
(stashed away the new code onto another commit and starts you on a fresh place???)
VIOLA! ;)
